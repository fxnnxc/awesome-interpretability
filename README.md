# Awesome Interpretability

We collect materials related to the interpretability which is an emerging field of understanding neural networks. Actually, we consider **mechanistic interpretability** in our mind. But, we think collecting general interpretability can grow the field in a better way. The tag (**M**) represent a post more related to the mecha interp.
